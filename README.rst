Introduction
============

geotools is a small collection of geometrical classes
and functions accessable from both Python and Cython.

 * Point, Vector & Planes

 * Transformations
 * A Camera class

A .pxd definition file is included so that it is possible to use
directly from Cython code.

Most of the code have been adapted from the openNURBS library (public domain).

The license is GPL v2.
